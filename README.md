# S2_soundbank_fixed
Decompiled (and modified) sound_events and sound_bank_database of Shogun 2 Total War.

See https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3128588750

Decompiled with Symphony https://www.twcenter.net/forums/showthread.php?478907-Symphony-(sound-unpacker-packer)

For some reason, it fails to recompile (Symphony complains about an invalid entry).
